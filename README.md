# python-reader
Tool for reading .txt files. Fun eBook reader.

Using books from sites like https://www.gutenberg.org/, the program can format and then read the book a chapter at a time. Using Matplotlib, the program can produce some graphs about word count and other unnecessary statistics. The program could have different user accounts and each user could have different permissions so they can only read certain books. The program could also read the books aloud.
